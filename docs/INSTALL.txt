pas.plugins.suisseid Installation
---------------------------------

Required libraries:

* Xmlsec (Debian package 'xmlsec1')

  Build manually on MAC with: 
  
  ./configure --with-openssl=/usr/local/php5 --disable-apps-crypto-dl --disable-crypto-dl

* pySAML2 (Download from http://launchpad.net/pysaml2/0.1/0.1/+download/pysaml2.0.1.tgz)

To install pas.plugins.suisseid into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:

* When you're reading this you have probably already run 
  ``easy_install pas.plugins.suisseid``. Find out how to install setuptools
  (and EasyInstall) here:
  http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

* If you are using Zope 2.9 (not 2.10), get `pythonproducts`_ and install it 
  via::

    python setup.py install --home /path/to/instance

into your Zope instance.

* Create a file called ``pas.plugins.suisseid-configure.zcml`` in the
  ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
  should only contain this::

    <include package="pas.plugins.suisseid" />

.. _pythonproducts: http://plone.org/products/pythonproducts


Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

* Add ``pas.plugins.suisseid`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        pas.plugins.suisseid
       
* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        pas.plugins.suisseid
      
* Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout
        
You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.
